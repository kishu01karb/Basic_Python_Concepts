#Task1
#Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
#1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
num1= float(input("enter the value of number 1 : "))
num2= float(input("enter the value of number 2 : "))
#2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
#o	Addition
add = num1+num2
print("Addiition of Two numbers are: ",add)
#o	Subtraction
sub = num1-num2
print("Subtraction of Two numbers are: ", sub)
#o	Multiplication
mul = num1*num2
print("Multiplication of Two numbers are : ",mul)
#o	Division
div = num1/num2
print("Divison of Two numbers are : ",div)
#3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.
